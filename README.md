# CycleThroughFiles

Save a lot of time swapping between related files with this extension!

This extension allow to cycle through files in the same folder that have the same name (without extension). This is a good substitute for the traditionnal F7 shortcut that allows to navigate from a cshtml to a cshtml.cs for example.

Two commands are available : CycleThroughFiles and CycleThroughFilesReverse (in reverse order)

Just replace the regular F7 keyboard shortcut with CycleThroughFiles and voil√†!  It's that easy!

In our organization we do nest together cshtml, cshtml.cs and .ts files for razor pages. It allows to swap quite rapidly between those files.
